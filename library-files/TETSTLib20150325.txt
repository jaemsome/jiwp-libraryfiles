This version of the library includes a few new things.  This library should 
support all the tutorials on the site.  It includes the following routines:

lcd.c (control HD44780 LCD displays)
masterI2C.c (read and write I2C devices)
rtos.c (real rtos)
servo.c (servo driver)
uart1.c (serial driver for uart 1)
usb (routines for USB).

There are a lot of bug fixes in this version.  Especially in the serial routines.
